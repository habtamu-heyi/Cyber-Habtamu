# 🧨 Local Privilege Escalation Lab (Linux)

This project explores techniques attackers use after gaining a shell to escalate privileges on a Linux machine.

---

## 🔍 Techniques Demonstrated

- Exploiting misconfigured `sudo` permissions
- Using `GTFOBins` commands to break out of restricted shells
- Kernel-based privilege escalation (using `dirtycow` or `overlayfs` exploits)

---

## ⚙️ Tools

- Bash
- Python
- GTFOBins
- Manual enumeration scripts

---

## 🚀 What This Lab Shows

1. Post-shell enumeration
2. Detecting and abusing privilege escalation vectors
3. Root shell access via controlled exploits

## 💡 Career Impact

Understanding and demonstrating LPE attacks is crucial for Red Teamers and defenders. This project is highly relevant to SOC and detection engineering roles at enterprise companies.
