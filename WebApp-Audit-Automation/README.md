# 🌐 Web Application Audit Automation Lab

This project automates scanning of web applications for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and outdated components. It simulates a real-world enterprise-grade audit process and generates simple reports for security teams.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- `nmap` — Network scanning
- `nikto` — Web server vulnerability scanner
- `python3` — Report parser
- `bash` — Script orchestration

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Scans web servers using Nmap and Nikto
2. Extracts findings using regex
3. Outputs to a Markdown report
